a. Net favorability: % favorable (very favorable + somewhat favorable) minus % unfavorable (somewhat unfavorable + very unfavorable)
b. Favorability ratio: % favorable (either very favorable or somewhat favorable) divided by % unfavorable (either somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable)
c. Total Favorability: % very favorable + % somewhat favorable

Please create a figure in R (ideally using ggplot2) displaying Total Favorability for the 17 individuals. The plots will be evaluated on accuracy and readability / appearance.
